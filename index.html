      <p align="justify">These two words from h1 define me like a person who just at the beggining of programming. I am a self-taught amateur with a willing to become a person who will answer question on stackoverflow. I define myself as a "scriptkid" or "n00b" - a person who know where another persons code can be used. I am trying not only use scripts but adapt it and teach myself on it's base.
      Thank you for reading some stuff about me. This is important for me.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p align="justify">Basic knowledge of Python and it's library. Using to automatize my routine activities such find and analyze data from the websites on daily basis. For these means I used such libraries like BeautifulSoup, requests, CSV, sys and a lot more. In plans - nympy, pandas and plotly for data vizualization</p>

              <h3>HTML5+CSS3</h3>
              <p align="justify">Not a very fan of front-end, but I have to learn it. But in my own, special way. As a "scriptkid" I did some stuff like fishing or webpage deface just for lulz. So to built a fishong site you can clone it. But to make phishing happen you better adapt it for the user who going to view it. And that how I learnt a bit about HTML5 and CSS. </p>
